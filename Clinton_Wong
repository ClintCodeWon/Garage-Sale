I like your project, because I think it has some real world potential. It could possibly expand into an actually enterprise outside of school. I see a real lack of this in the world. 


I can contribute as much as possible, I am willing to learn new techonology and new skills in order to complete this project. 

Business: it's lacking in the business front so far, we need to draft up a business plan and a way to become profitible. 

Legal: we need some legal expertises in this matter as well, we have no idea the legal issues surround this topic. 

Techincal: We have enough techincal skills between the 4 of us to complete this project.
